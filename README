exitop - exim near real-time mail flow monitoring
=================================================

Exitop is a perl utility to show the mail that is moving through
an exim server in near real-time. It reads multiple exim (or
syslogged) logfiles either as files specified in the arguments or
on STDIN. The screen is updated with latest information about mail
flow as it happens. It is especially useful to view top-talkers,
mail loops and bulk mailings.


Invocation
----------

Exitop will accept data on STDIN or tail files that are passed as
arguments. The following are all legal:

  exitop /var/log/exim/mainlog

  exitop /var/log/exim/server1.main /var/log/exim/server2.main

  tail -f /var/log/exim/server1.main | exitop /var/log/exim/server2.main

If the logfiles are in syslog format, then the "syslog2exim"
script can convert them to a quasi-exim log format that can be
read. This functionality is built-in to exitop since version 0.02,
so it is not necessary to pre-process logs with syslog2exim before
reading into exitop.
